- 👋 Hi, I’m @MisterBourbaki
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, in particular Federated Learning (I created the project [Pybiscus](https://github.com/MisterBourbaki/pybiscus) last year), in Vector Quantization (I collaborate on the really nice https://github.com/lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch project) and AutoEncoders, in particular for audio (have a look here https://github.com/MisterBourbaki/Encyclopedia-VAE!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit of Rust! Trying to catch on this really nice language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Federated Learning, Vector Quantization or AutoEncoders :)
- 📫 How to reach me: here is my pro email bmorisse.pro@proton.me !
- I worked three years as a Data Scientist at Thales, and before that I was a 'pure' mathematician working on PDEs. I did my PhD at Universite Paris Diderot and did a three-year postdoc at Cardiff, not so long ago :)
